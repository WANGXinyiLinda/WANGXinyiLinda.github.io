## Reinforcement Learning Trading Algorithm

* **Policy Gradient Trading Algorithm by Maximizing Sharpe Ratio** (Capstone 2)
  * Xinyi Wang, Yuan Yao. \[[report](https://github.com/WANGXinyiLinda/Policy-Gradient-Trading-Algorithm-by-Maximizing-Sharpe-Ratio/blob/master/SCIE4500_Final_Report.pdf)\]\[[repo](https://github.com/WANGXinyiLinda/Policy-Gradient-Trading-Algorithm-by-Maximizing-Sharpe-Ratio)\]\[[slides](https://github.com/WANGXinyiLinda/Policy-Gradient-Trading-Algorithm-by-Maximizing-Sharpe-Ratio/blob/master/SCIE4500_Final_presentation.pdf)\]
  * Jul 2019 - Feb 2019 
  * Under the supervision of Prof. Yuan Yao, I designed a trading algorithm using policy gradient to directly maximize the Sharpe ratio over a fixed period of time. The proposed algorithm performs significantly better than the Q learning baseline on a Bitcoin dataset. 

* **Bitcoin Trading Agent with Deep Q-Learning Algorithms** (Capstone 1)
  * Xinyi Wang, Yuan Yao. \[[report](https://github.com/WANGXinyiLinda/Deep-Q-Learning-Bitcoin-Trading-Agent/blob/master/SCIE3500_Final_Report.pdf)\]\[[repo](https://github.com/WANGXinyiLinda/Deep-Q-Learning-Bitcoin-Trading-Agent)\]
  * Sep 2018 - Dec 2018
  * I continue to explore the topic of my RIPS-HK 2018 group project and proposed some variants of deep Q learning trading algorithm.

* **Applying Q-Learning to Algorithmic Bitcoin Trading** (RIPS-HK)
  * Chun Ho Chris Park, Matthew Thomas Sturm, Katherine Thai, Xinyi Linda Wang. \[[report](https://github.com/chpark17/rips_realai/blob/master/RIPS_HK_2018_Final_Report.pdf)\]\[[repo](https://github.com/chpark17/rips_realai)\]
  * Jun 2018 - Aug 2018
  * I participated in the Research in Industrial Projects for Students (RIPS-HK), sponsored by HKUST Math department, IPAM at UCLA and RealAI. Our team implemented several Q learning trading algorithms, all of which outperform the buy-and-hold strategy baseline.

## Computer Vision in Biostatistics

* **Cell Counting by Adaptive Fully Convolutional Redundant Counting** (Course project)
  * Xinyi Wang, Daofu Zhang, Dajun Sun \[[report](https://github.com/WANGXinyiLinda/adaptive-count-ception/blob/master/4901J_final_report.pdf)\]\[[repo](https://github.com/WANGXinyiLinda/adaptive-count-ception)\]\[[slides](https://github.com/WANGXinyiLinda/adaptive-count-ception/blob/master/4901J_final_presentation.pdf)\]
  * May 2019 - Jan 2019
  * To enable fast domain transfer between different kinds of cells in the cell counting task, we propose to pre-train the network on a simple dataset, then freeze the domain agnostic parameters and only train the domain-specific parameter on a new dataset. Experiment results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the training-from-scratch baselines.
