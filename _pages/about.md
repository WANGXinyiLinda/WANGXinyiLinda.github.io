I'm a final year HKUST student majoring in applied mathematics and computer science. Currently, I am on exchange at UCLA. I am applying for graduate schools starting in 2020 fall. My research interest lies in machine learning and artificial intelligence in general, with a special focus on natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning. I worked with [Prof. Yi Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Prh_dHkAAAAJ&hl=en) in the past year on several NLP related projects. \[[CV](/pdf/Resume.pdf)\]
