I'm a first year PhD student in the computer science department at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). I am glad to have [Prof. William Yang Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/index.html ) as my advisor and my current research interest is adeversarial training in NLP. I graduated from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2020 with a B.Sc in applied mathematics and computer science. I was on exchange at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) from September to December, 2019. I also had the fortune to work with [Prof. Yi Yang](http://yya518.github.io/) and [Prof. Yuan Yao](https://yao-lab.github.io/).
