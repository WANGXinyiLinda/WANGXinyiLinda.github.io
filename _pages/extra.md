### Bagstorm: Art and Sustainablity

* As a member of the executive committee of WILL, a HKUST student society, I lead the organization of **Bagstorm**, a student event in collaboration with the HKUST Sustainability Unit. At the event, We priovide blank cloth bags and pigments to participants so that they can freely draw on their own bags. The purpose of this event was to use art creation as way to relax since UST students are aways so stessful. We also encourage them to use the reusable bags created by themselves instead of plastic bags.
