## Extra Curriculums

### Bagstorm: Art and Sustainablity

* As a member of the executive committee of WILL, a HKUST student society, I lead the organization of **Bagstorm**, a student event collaborating with the HKUST Sustainability Unit. At the event, We priovide blank cloth bags and pigments to the participants and let them draw their own bags. The purpose of this event was to encourage students to use reusable bags instead of plastic bags and to create a chance for them to decompress by painting. I was the person in charge of this event.
