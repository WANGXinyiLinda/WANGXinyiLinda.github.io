## Bagstorm: Art and Sustainablity

* As a member of the executive committee of WILL, an HKUST student society, I lead the organization of **Bagstorm**, a student event in collaboration with the HKUST Sustainability Unit. At the event, We provided blank cloth bags and pigments to participants and enough time for them to draw on their own bags freely. The purpose of this event was to use art creation as a way to relax since UST students are aways so stressful, and I always find painting a great way to release pressure for myself for many years. We also encouraged them to use the reusable bags created by themselves instead of plastic bags for sustainability.
