I'm a second year PhD student in the computer science department at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). I am glad to have professor [William Yang Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/index.html) as my advisor. I am interested in improving the robustness, generalizability and fairness of machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning algorithms. My research currently focuses on causality based methods and the application to NLP tasks. 
<!-- I graduated from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2020 with a B.Sc. in applied mathematics and computer science.  -->
<!-- I was on exchange at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) from September to December, 2019.  -->
<!-- I also had the fortune to work with [Yi Yang](http://yya518.github.io/) and [Prof. Yuan Yao](https://yao-lab.github.io/).  -->
